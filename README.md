# VLC RPC Plugin for Discord.  

Makes use of VLC Media Player's http interface and the pypresence package for python to send media information to Discord.  
Make sure to enable the VLC http interface and put your password into the vlc_rich.cmd script if you want to use it.  
The vlc_rich.cmd script is there in case you want to use virtual enviroments (venv).  
You also need to register your own app on Discord so that you can get a client id that the app can connect to Discord.  
If you don't know how to register your own app on Discord then you can read more about it [here](https://discord.com/developers/docs/game-sdk/sdk-starter-guide).
